I introduce good textbooks I have encountered so far. The selection criteria are roughly:

* Not redundant
* Clear and concise
* No ambiguous expressions
* Abundant examples
* Rich exercise problems
* Appropriate use of terminology
* Excellent structure and design

That said, I am not evaluating them quantitatively.

## Quantum Mechanics

* David J. Griffiths, Darrell F. Schroeter, "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics", 3rd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2018.

A standard textbook on quantum mechanics, needless to say. Honestly, I believe there is no textbook that surpasses this one in the world today. It is written very concisely with abundant examples and exercise problems. Although the content is for beginners, it covers all topics typically handled in undergraduate lectures. The exercise problems address themes not seen in similar textbooks. If you can understand this textbook thoroughly, you can say you have sufficiently understood the basics of quantum mechanics.
