<div class="theorem">

1. Adding or removing a finite number of terms does not affect the convergence of an infinite series.

2. If a series converges absolutely, rearranging its terms does not change the sum.

3. If a series is conditionally convergent, appropriately rearranging its terms can make it converge to a different value or diverge.

4. If the series $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ both converge, then $\sum (\alpha a_n + \beta b_n) = \alpha \sum a_n + \beta \sum b_n$ holds.

5. $(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n) (\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n$ (where $c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}$) holds.

6. Power series can be differentiated and integrated term by term within their region of convergence.
