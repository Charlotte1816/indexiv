Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of numbers or functions.

<div class="definition">

* $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N$ is called the $N$-th **partial sum** of $\{a_n\}$.

* The infinite series $S = \lim_{N\to\infty} S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ is called the **sum of the series** (when the limit exists).

* A series **converges** when the limit exists.

* A series **diverges** when the limit does not exist.

* When $a_n=b_n x^n$ ($b_n$ is a constant), $S$ is called a **power series**.

* When $a_n = (-1)^n|a_n|$, $S$ is called an **alternating series**.

* When $\sum|a_n|$ converges, the series is said to **converge absolutely**.

* When $S_N$ converges but does not converge absolutely, the series is said to **converge conditionally**.
